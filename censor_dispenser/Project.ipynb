That's how we know XXX considers XXXself to be a XXX! We asked!\\n\\nHow cool is that? We didn't expect a personality to develop this early on in the process but it seems like a rudimentary XXXXX XX XXXX is starting to form. This is a major step in the process, as having a XXXXX XX XXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX will allow XXX to see the problems the world is facing and make hard but necessary decisions for the betterment of the planet.\\n\\nWe are a-buzz down in the lab with excitement over these developments and we hope that the investors share our enthusiasm.\\n\\nTill next month,\\nFrancine, Head Scientist\\n\""
